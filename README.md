I have used transfer learning on the Tacotron model to train and test it.

1. Started with Downloading a Vedio of Narendra Modi
2. Used X2downlaod.com to download the vedio
3. Used Cloudconvert to change from mp4 to mp3
3. used acapella Extractor.com to remove bg musics
5. Project rate changing from 44100
6. Export all the audio files
7. Running of the model as explained in the video.
